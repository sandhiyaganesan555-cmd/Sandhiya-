## 🧩 How It Works

1. The user enters details like **name, email, password, phone number**, etc.  
2. The **JavaScript validation script** checks each field in real time.  
3. If any input is invalid, a clear **error message** is displayed.  
4. Once all fields are valid, the form can be successfully submitted.
